# hello-world
This is what happens when you're new to GitHub and are excited to learn.

My name is Ominini and I have recently began a learning journey on udacity to bring myself up to date with mordern technology trends so as to make myself job ready when I finish school. I am a Business Analyst with vast knowledge of predictive techniques used to better inform business decisions. I am looking to learn data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence within the next year or so.
